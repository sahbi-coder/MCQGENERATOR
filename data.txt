Napoleon Bonaparte was a French military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and became one of the most influential figures in European history. Born in 1769 on the island of Corsica, he quickly advanced through the army due to his strategic skill and leadership. In 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of France, marking the beginning of a period of expansion in which he conquered much of Europe. His rule introduced important reforms, including the Napoleonic Code, which standardized laws and influenced legal systems worldwide. Despite his early successes, Napoleon’s ambitions eventually led to defeat, and after losing key battles such as Waterloo in 1815, he was exiled, bringing an end to his reign.
